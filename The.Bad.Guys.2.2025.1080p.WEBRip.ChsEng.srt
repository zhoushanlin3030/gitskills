00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,620
你们都去哪儿了
Where you been keeping yourselves?

148
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,950
我吗
Me?

149
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,740
太棒了
Oh, terrific.

150
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,080
棒极了
Fantastic.

151
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,410
我的意思是虽然不是每个人都相信
I mean, not everyone believes it,

152
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,960
但 呃 坏蛋联盟已经改过自新了
but, uh, the Bad Guys went good.

153
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,590
我就不赘述细节了
I'll spare you the details,

154
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,420
但总而言之  我们都感受到了做好事的快乐
but in a nutshell, we felt the wag of doing good.

155
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,800
顺便交了几个新朋友…
Made a couple of new friends...

156
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,840
黛安狐
Diane?

157
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,800
你是深红魔爪吗
You're the Crimson Paw?

158
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,180
我们拿下了橘子酱  一个真正的坏蛋
We took down Marmalade, a real bad guy.

159
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,760
深红魔爪
The Crimson Paw!

160
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,350
我 不 不 她才是深红魔爪
Me? No, no, no. She's the Crimson Paw.

161
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,560
还让所有人大吃一惊
And surprised everyone

162
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,020
我们自首了
by turning ourselves in.

163
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,940
是啊 我们当坏蛋的岁月其实过得挺滋润的
Yeah, we had a pretty good run as bad guys,

164
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,940
但有时为了迎来更好的生活
but sometimes you got to give up the thing you know

165
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,230
你必须离开你的舒适区
in order to find something better.

166
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,820
所以我们服刑期满后变成了遵纪守法的公民
So here we are, law-abiding citizens

167
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,860
清清白白 重新开始
starting over with a clean slate,

168
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,200
我们迫不及待地期待社会张开双臂欢迎我们
and we cannot wait for society to welcome us with open arms.

169
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,710
那…那你的求职意向… 呃…在银行工作吗
And-and now you want to work, uh, at-at a bank?

170
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,340
为什么不呢 我最好的回忆都是在银行
Why not? Some of my best memories are at banks.

171
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,260
呃 你抢了我们三次
Uh, you robbed us three times.

172
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,090
是你们这家银行吗
That was this bank?

173
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,850
这里写着你从一只邪恶的豚鼠手中拯救了城市
It says here that you saved the city from an evil guinea pig,

174
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,680
但你就不是一个臭名昭著的罪犯吗
but aren't you a notorious criminal?

175
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,140
是啊 不是
Yes. No.

176
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,400
也…也许吧
M-Maybe?

177
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,860
抱…抱歉 有点紧张
Sor... Sorry, nerves.

178
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,690
我…我的意思是 我…我还能 模仿金枪鱼 模仿得特别像
I-I mean, I-I can also do a great tuna impression.

179
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,860
就好像你在和一条金枪鱼说话 对吧
It's like you're talking to a tuna, right?

180
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,820
嗯 我精通各种操作系统
Well, I'm proficient in Unix, Linux, Windows, Mac

181
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,990
并且流利掌握87种编程语言
and fluent in 87 coding languages,

182
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,910
所以 是的 我绝对够格
so, yeah, I'm qualified.

183
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,990
我明白了
I see.

184
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,370
那么 嗯 你如何解释
And, um, how do you explain

185
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,250
你工作经历中的这段空窗期呢
this gap in your employment history?

186
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,500
我的期望薪资
My salary expectations?

187
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
哇哦 这是个好问题
Wow. That's a good question.

188
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,880
以前从没有人主动给过我钱
No one's ever given me money on purpose before.

189
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,300
“擅长秘密圣诞老人探险”
"Great at Secret Santa"?

190
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,880
是啊 那是什么…
Yeah. How does that...

191
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,930
等…等等 别说出来
W-W-Wait. Don't tell me.

192
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,350
泡澡球 薰衣草味的
Bath bomb. Lavender.

193
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,390
如果你看到同事 做了一些违反公司规定的事
And how would you react if you saw a coworker doing something

194
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,730
你会怎么做
that violates company policy?

195
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,400
告密者没好下场  等着喂鱼吧
Snitches get stitches and sleep with the fishes.

196
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,690
不好意思 我能再…
You know what? Can I act--

197
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,360
再回答一次那个问题吗
Can I get another chance at that one?

198
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,110
我想我们已经了解得差不多了
I think we got everything we need.

199
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,490
很高兴见到你 谢谢你来参加面试
- So great to meet you. - Thanks for coming in.

200
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,450
呃 我们决定… 我们决定不录用你
Uh, we're gonna... we're gonna pass.

201
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,200
呃 听着 克雷格  任何想改变的人
Uh, look, Craig, anyone who wants to change

202
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,080
总需要一个起点 对吧
needs to start somewhere, right?

203
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,500
所以我只是需要一个机会
So I'm just asking for a chance.

204
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,420
就一个机会
Just a chance.

205
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,800
拜托
Please?

206
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,380
既然这样 大坏狼先生
You know what, Mr. Wolf?

207
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,680
我这里也许…你知道 如果...
I might-- you know, I might,

208
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,090
如果这里有适合你的职位
I might have something here for you.

209
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,430
我会给你打电话
I'm gonna give you a call.

210
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,260
天哪 真…真的吗
Gee. R-Really?

211
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,180
克雷格 那太棒了
Craig, that's great!

212
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,100
手机号码就在我的简历上 就在那上面
Number's on my résumé there.

213
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,900
好的 呃… 这真是太棒了
- Okay. Uh... - And this has been just great.

214
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,310
你可以放手了 抱歉
- You can let go now. - Sorry.

215
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,610
我不是故意的…
I didn't mean to...

216
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,490
我找到工作了 这太棒了 伙计
I got a job! This is fantastic, man.

217
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,950
哦 对了 克雷格  呃 你知道…
Oh, by the way, Craig, uh, you know...

218
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,620
是的 懂了
Yeah. Got it.

219
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,980
…为了更美好的未来
...to a better future.

220
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,190
三周后 我的下一代 月亮X号火箭将发射升空
In three weeks, my next-gen MoonX rocket will blast off

221
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,530
并部署X3能量电池
and deploy the Power Cell X3.

222
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,820
没错
That's right.

223
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,200
免费无线充电 从外太空
Free wireless charging from outer space

224
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
直接充到你的手机
directly to your phone.

225
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,330
-不用谢 全世界 嘿 伙计们 -嘿 -大坏狼
- You're welcome, world. - Hey, guys. -Hey! -Wolfie.

226
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,120
大坏狼 你找到工作了
Wolf! So you got the job?

227
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,410
嗯 我的意思是虽然还不是板上钉钉
Well, I mean, it's not a hundred percent,

228
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,540
但他说他说他会给我打电话
but he said, he said he'd call me.

229
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,880
好吧 你比食人鱼强
Well, you did better than Piranha.

230
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,000
我以为我应该 表现出自信
I thought I was supposed to project confidence.

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,630
是啊 但为什么要模仿金枪鱼
Yeah, but why a tuna?

232
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,050
什么 金枪鱼很自信啊
What? Tunas are confident.

233
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,010
你认识哪条金枪鱼不自信的
What tuna do you know that's not confident?

234
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,090
所有的金枪鱼
All of them.

235
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,680
金枪鱼很自信 对吧
- Tunas are confident. - Right?

236
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,850
伙计们 别这样 生活就像飙车
Guys, come on. Life's like a car chase.

237
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,390
你们懂我的意思吧 路上总会有颠簸
You know what I mean? There's-there's gonna be

238
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,850
但困难何曾阻止过我们呢
bumps in the road, but when has that ever stopped us?

239
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,980
绝不
Never.

240
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,770
我们只需要一点时间
It's just gonna take a little time,

241
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,150
但我向你们保证人们一定会接受我们的
but I promise you, people will come around.

242
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,070
就算我们被陷害 替幻影大盗的连环罪行背锅 人们也能接受我们吗
Even if we get framed for the Phantom Bandit's crime spree?

243
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,360
说得也太具体了
That's awfully specific.

244
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,490
谁是幻影…呃…谁
Who's the Phantom, uh-- Who?

245
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,820
你没听说吗 新闻里到处都是
You haven't heard? It's all over the news.

246
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,740
一场为了生存的 战斗正在…
There's a battle of survival for the bil--

247
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,700
幻影大盗昨天袭击了三处地方
The Phantom Bandit hit three locations yesterday,

248
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,040
偷走了几件无价的珍品
stealing several priceless artifacts.

249
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,580
幻影大盗致所有出名 就是因为根本找不到他的踪迹
The Phantom is known for being impossible to trace,

250
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,250
但这一次  他留下了一张名片
but this time, he left a calling card.

251
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,800
等等 那是我们的招牌动作
Wait, hey, hey! That's our move.

252
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,220
没错
Exactly.

253
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,470
警官 坏蛋联盟是重操旧业
Commissioner, are the Bad Guys back to a life of crime,

254
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,340
还是被陷害了
or are they being framed?

255
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,180
就像你留着漂亮刘海的脸庞一样
Just like your face with those fabulous bangs!

256
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,720
谢谢 我自己剪的刘海
Thank you. I cut them myself.

257
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,230
听着 我不能对正在进行的调查发表评论
Look, I cannot comment on an ongoing investigation,

258
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,020
但这么说吧 江山易改 本性难移
but let's just say: once a con, always a con.

259
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,150
所以是不是坏蛋联盟干的 我无可奉告
- So it's the Bad Guys? - I said no comment!

260
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,530
别这样 什么
- Come on. - What?

261
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,070
我们要怎么 重新开始
How are we supposed to get a fresh start

262
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,530
如果发生的每件坏事 都怪到我们头上
when we get blamed for every bad thing that happens?

263
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,990
嘿 伙计们
Hey, guys.

264
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,620
今天的太阳 是不是格外明媚
Isn't the sun particularly radiant today?

265
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,420
你穿的是什么鬼啊 你在喝的又是什么啊
- What are you wearing? - What are you drinking?

266
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,880
加了额外螺旋藻的草本康普茶
Wheatgrass kombucha with extra moss

267
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
再加两罐冷榨蒲公英
and two shots of cold-pressed dandelion.

268
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,260
呃 我觉得那些东西好像不该吃
Uh, I don't think you're supposed to eat those things.

269
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,970
哦 你们啊
Aw, you guys.

270
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,140
我真希望能和你们开开轻松的玩笑
I wish I could trade lighthearted japes

271
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,140
再聊上一整晚  但我流瑜伽要迟到了
with you all night, but I'm late for vinyasa.

272
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,440
流瑜伽 等…等等 你要出门啊
- Vinyasa? - W-W-Wait. You're going out?

273
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,770
但你…你刚回来
But y-you just got back.

274
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,400
你知道的
You know how it is.

275
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,110
你以为我这身材是坐着看电视练出来的
You think I got this body by sitting around, watching TV?

276
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,440
好吧 恶心 哦 别等我了
- Okay, ew. - Oh, and don't wait up for me.

277
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,030
今晚可是摔角之夜
It's lucha night.

278
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,160
那 再见…
Well, bye...!

279
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,290
伙计们 我觉得 康普茶把他的脑子喝坏了
Guys, I think the kombucha ate his brain.

280
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,290
嘿 你知道吗 只要他开心就好 对吧
Hey, you know what? As long as he's happy, right?

281
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,500
那你呢 我会更开心的
- And you're not? - I'd be happier

282
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,460
如果我能找到一份工作的话
if I could land one of these jobs.

283
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,430
第一印象很难改变
- First impressions are hard to shake.

284
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,510
哦 那倒挺快的
Ooh, that was quick.

285
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,760
我的意思是 我第一次见你时
I mean, when I first met you,

286
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,020
我觉得你傲慢自大 自以为是
I thought you were arrogant, self-satisfied,

287
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,480
不诚实…
dishonest...

288
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,890
…贪婪 我很确定
...greedy, for sure.

289
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,980
哦 是吗 是什么改变了你的看法
Oh, yeah? What changed your mind?

290
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,150
你什么意思
What do you mean?

291
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,730
哈哈 真好笑
Ha ha ha. Very funny.

292
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,150
说真的 当我们一再被拒绝
Seriously, it's hard

293
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,820
真的很难一直保持积极的态度
to stay positive when we keep getting rejected.

294
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,490
我不确定这样是不是让你感觉绝望
It makes you feel-- I don't know-- hopeless.

295
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,160
我的意思是改过自新是我做过的最难的事
I mean, going good was the hardest thing that I ever did.

296
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,420
和你们比起来  我算容易的了
And compared to you guys, I had it easy.

297
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,880
从来没人知道 我是深红魔爪
No one ever knew I was the Crimson Paw.

298
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,170
抱歉  你刚才说你是
I'm sorry, did you say you were the

299
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,880
深红魔爪
Crimson Paw?!

300
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,180
抱歉
Sorry.

301
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,180
我没太听清
I didn't quite catch that.

302
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,680
好吧 这可是你自己要挑战我的
Okay, you asked for it.

303
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,020
你马上就会知道 为什么他们叫我
You're about to discover why they call me

304
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,520
大坏狼
the Big Bad Wo--

305
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,240
我想我有点飘了
I think I got carried away.

306
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,280
我觉得这对我的面试没好处
I don't think this is gonna help my-- with my interviews.

307
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,410
我不知道 但我觉得这名字挺可爱的
I don't know. I think it's cute.

308
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,700
让你更有个性了 哦
- Gives you character. - Oh.

309
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,080
我是脑震荡了 还是 州长在跟我调情
Do I have a concussion, or is the governor flirting with me?

310
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,800
不能两者都有吗
- Can't it be both? - Hmm.

311
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,630
抱歉 我不该… 哦 不 不
- Sorry, I shouldn't have... - Oh, no, no, no.

312
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,050
我…我其实没 嗯…
I-I didn't really, um...

313
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,140
呃 是啊 因为 你是州长
Uh, yeah, 'cause you're the governor,

314
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,680
而我 你知道的 -我有前科
- and I'm, you know. - An-an ex-con.

315
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,560
是的 我懂
- Yeah. - I know.

316
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,770
形象问题
It's optics.

317
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,350
完全是 我们就…
- Totally. - Let's just...

318
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,940
-是啊 就保持朋友关系吧 -保持朋友关系
- Yeah, let's keep it friendly. - ...keep it friendly.

319
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,730
-普通朋友么 -是的
- Medium friendly? - Yeah.

320
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,860
州长女士 哎呀
- Madam Governor. - Oops.

321
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,520
州长女士
Madam Governor.

322
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,530
抱歉打扰 和您熟人…
Sorry to interrupt you and your acquaintance...

323
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,070
她终于记住我名字了
Finally, she remembers my name.

324
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,700
…但您20分钟后还有儿童医院的筹款活动
...but you've got the children's hospital fundraiser in 20 minutes.

325
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,240
我马上就到 莫琳 哦 好的 谢谢
- I'll be right there, Maureen. - Oh, good. Thank you.

326
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,830
又一个筹款活动
Another fundraiser?

327
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,240
哦 看看你
Oof, look at you.

328
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,250
下周这个时间呢
Same time next week?

329
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,580
我都有空
My calendar's wide open.

330
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,960
我知道这很难  但你还是要有希冀 好吗
I know it's tough, but you can't lose hope, okay?

331
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,970
人们确实想信任你
People do want to trust you.

332
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,680
你只需要给他们一个理由
You just have to give them a reason.

333
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,760
你保证
Promise?

334
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,470
以州长的名义保证
Governor's word.

335
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,600
但在此之前 我建议你 练练你的右勾拳
But until then, I would work on that right hook.

336
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,060
感觉有点像被蝴蝶亲了一下的触感
It feels a little like I'm getting kissed by a butterfly.

337
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,730
回头见 硬汉
Catch you later, tough guy.

338
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,360
我那是手下留情了
I was holding back.

339
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,580
“给他们一个理由 ”
"Give them a reason."

340
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,840
我不
No!

341
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,630
我说无可奉告
I said no comment!

342
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,090
我想要答案
I want answers.

343
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,640
给我调监控录像  查通话记录
Get me security footage, scour the phone logs,

344
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,600
我的咖啡呢
and where's my coffee?!

345
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,010
呃 警官 现在不行
- Uh, Commissioner? - Not now!

346
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,930
但你有访客 让他们等着
- But you have a visitor. - They can wait.

347
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,180
呃 但他 呃…
Uh, but he's, uh...

348
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,100
嘿嘿 警长
Hey-hey, Chief!

349
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,310
我能说
Can I just say:

350
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,150
喜欢你的刘海吗
love the bangs.

351
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,520
首先  我现在是局长
First off, it's "Commissioner" now.

352
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,780
其次…
And second...

353
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,360
哦 不错嘛 可是那有什么区别呢
Ooh, nice. What's the difference?

354
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,030
嗯 警长是一线警官中级别最高的 而局长
Well, the chief is the top uniformed , whereas--

355
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,660
我为什么要跟你解释这个
Why am I explaining this to you?!

356
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,990
你动了我的线索板
Did you touch my board?

357
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,750
-我的线索板 我精致的线索板 -哦 抱歉
- My board. My beautiful board. - Oh, I'm sorry.

358
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,750
我仿佛听到你的线索板在说  快点破案
I thought I heard it say, "Solve me."

359
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,830
大坏狼 听着
- Wolf. - Listen.

360
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,670
我觉得我们都有打造形象的需求
I think we're both having an optics problem.

361
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,130
你需要向公众证明
You need to show the world

362
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,880
这次调查都很顺利you've got this investigation under control,

363
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
而我们需要向全世界都知道我们已经是好人
and we need to show the world we're good.

364
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,930
如果我帮你抓住大盗  那就是双赢
If I help you catch the Bandit, it's a win-win.

365
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,180
我要给州长打电话
I'm calling the governor.

366
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,760
打吧 这全是她的主意
Go ahead. It was basically her idea.

367
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,430
看这儿
Look at this.

368
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,690
每次抢劫都发生在三分钟的时间窗口内
Each of the robberies occurred within a three-minute window.

369
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,860
所以呢 这三分钟时间就是安保控制台
- So? - Three minutes is the loop rate

370
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,520
循环速率的刷新频率
of most standard security consoles,

371
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,230
这意味着不管是谁干的…
which means whoever did this...

372
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,190
从内部黑进了安保系统
Patched into security from the inside.

373
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,530
对
Bingo.

374
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,070
好吧
Fine.

375
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,530
就算他们做到了 我们怎么抓到他们呢
Let's say they did. How would we even trace that?

376
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,460
我们需要高科技的电脑专家
We'd need some kind of high-tech computer expert.

377
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,790
他们必须寻觅出攻击的IP地址 并将视频流重定向
They'd have had to clone the IP address and redirect the feed

378
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,380
到一个4GHz的虚拟控制台
to a four gigahertz dummy console, duh.

379
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,210
你的大盗都很聪明
Your Bandit is clever

380
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,090
但没他自己想的那么聪明
but not as clever as he thinks he is.

381
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,260
但要完成这些他还是需要一个内应
However, he'd still need an inside man.

382
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,890
拿着这个
Hold this.

383
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,770
看那
There!

384
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,060
那只是个清洁工
But that's just the janitor.

385
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,110
在没受过训练的人眼里确实如此
Perhaps to the untrained eye,

386
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,440
但如果他真的只是个清洁工
but if he's really just the janitor,

387
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,740
他为什么推着一个空桶
why is he pushing around an empty bucket?

388
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,330
所以真正的问题是 他是怎么进去的
So the real question is: How did he get in?

389
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,040
我会从这边过来 卡住风扇
I'd come this way, jam the fan,

390
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,790
撬开格栅  然后砰 就进去了
pop the grate, and bam, you're in.

391
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,710
这里面为什么有酸黄瓜
Why is there pickles in this?

392
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,090
因为那是我午餐
Because that's my lunch.

393
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,840
谁让你吃我午餐的
Who said you could eat my lunch?

394
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,090
是他说这里管饭
Well, he said there was lunch.

395
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,010
警长 拜托 我们专心点
Chief, come on. Let's focus.

396
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,050
我们知道了作案时间 和作案手法
So we know when and we know how.

397
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,430
真正的问题应该是作案动机
The real question is why.

398
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,600
嗯 你怎么不再多叫些人
Well, why don't you call some more people

399
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,060
来一起帮忙
to barge in and help?

400
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,440
你好 朋友
Welcome, friend,

401
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,070
这里是贪心蛇的语音信箱
to Mr. Snake's voicemail.

402
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,700
今天的灵魂箴言是
Today's advice for the soul:

403
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,200
我们需要把关注点从我们之间差异点跳出来
We must stop concentrating on our differences

404
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,660
而去寻找我们的共同之处
and look for what we have in common.

405
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,410
南无阿弥佗佛
- Namaste. - Ugh.

406
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,120
再见…
Bye...!

407
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,250
他被附身了吗
Is he possessed?

408
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,840
呃 别提了
Ugh, don't even get me started.

409
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,250
我的意思是 有一天他去练瑜伽 做陶艺
I mean, one day he's going to yoga, he's doing pottery.

410
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,050
可是谁会做陶艺 人鬼情未了的演员吗
I mean, who does pottery, the cast of Ghost?

411
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,590
伙计们 伙计们 等等
Guys, guys, guys, guys. Hold on.

412
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,130
啊 他刚才说什么来着
- Huh? - What'd he say again?

413
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,140
“去寻找我们 的共同之处 ”
"Look for what we have in common."

414
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,930
看 重点不是 那些艺术品
Look. It's not about the artifacts.

415
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,680
重点是 它们的共同之处
It's about what they have in common.

416
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,730
它们都是用一种叫“反黄金” 的稀有金属制成的
They're all made from a rare metal called MacGuffinite.

417
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,810
当然了
Of course.

418
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,610
呃 反黄金什么玩意儿
Uh, MacGuff-a-what, now?

419
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,320
嗯 听起来有点像编的
Um, sounds kind of made-up.

420
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,780
金子这东西 如果你不知道它真的存在 听起来也像编的
So does the word "gold" if you didn't know it was real.

421
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,190
说“金子”
Say "gold."

422
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,240
-金子 -金子  -金子
- Gold. Gold. -Gold. Gold. - Gold. Gold. -Gold. Gold.

423
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,910
-金子 -金子 -金子
- Gold. - Gold. -Gold.

424
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,530
听起来确实像编的
That does sound made-up.

425
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,290
哦 现在我总觉得 这词听起来很怪 金子
Oh, now I can't stop thinking how it sounds weird. Gold.

426
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,290
所以现在我们知道 大盗想要什么了…
So now that we know what the Bandit is after...

427
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,370
我们就能弄清楚 他下一步要袭击哪里
We can figure out where he's gonna strike next!

428
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,340
这才对嘛 这才是我认识的警长
There you go. That's the chief I know.

429
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,380
嗯 你最近自己磨磨咖啡豆了吗
Mmm. You grinding your own beans these days?

430
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,010
叫“局长”
It's "Commissioner."

431
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,590
现在离开我的办公室
Now get out of my office.

432
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,640

? Shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah... ?

435
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,940
接下来  我们就上电视领奖章了
Next thing you know, we're on TV getting medals.

436
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,850

你能想象他在摔角比赛现场吗

668
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,800

But-but that's nothing compared to our first date

那就是全州的警察都以为我们是幻影大盗

请大家不要急于下结论
Please, let's not jump to conclusions

683
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,500
在我们掌握所有事实之前

00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,140
大坏狼 黛安狐 听着
WOLF Diane, listen.

694
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,640
我们遇到了一点麻烦
We hit a little bit of trouble.

695
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,940
哦 哪部分
Oh. Which part?

696
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,690
袭击局长那部分
Assaulting the police commissioner

697
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,270
还是在成千上万人面前 偷走一条无价的腰带那部分
or stealing a priceless belt in front of thousands of people?

698
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,860
事情不是看到的那样
It's-it's not what it looks like.

699
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,990
有人在陷害我们 你得相信我
Someone's setting us up. You got to believe me.

700
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,820
我当然相信你
Of course I believe you.

701
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,410
嗯 你可能是 唯一一个了
Well, you might be the only one.

702
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,870
听着 我们现在真的需要 你的帮助
Listen, we could really use your help right now.

703
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,040
大坏狼 我不能撤回警力
Wolf, I can't call off the cops.

704
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,540
现在风头太紧了
There's too much heat on you.

705
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,000
我知道 我知道
I know. I know. I know. I know.

706
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,330
如果你能给我一些线索
If you could just give me something to work with,

707
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,920
或者一…一条线索 一个提示 什么都行
a-a clue, a starting place, something.

708
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,880
我只知道这事跟那个
All I know is, it-it's got something to do

709
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,670
反黄金有关
with that MacGuffinite thing.

710
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,380
-反黄金 真的吗 -是的
- MacGuffinite? Really? - Yeah.

711
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,220
那一直都是大盗的目标
It's what the Bandit's been after the whole time.

712
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,930
我不想把你拖下水  但这是我们唯一的线索
I hate to drag you into this, but it's our only lead.

713
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,390
你能调查一下吗
Can you look into it?

714
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,060
是的 我正好知道该问谁
Yeah, I know exactly who to ask.

715
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,690
是吗 听我说
- You do? - Listen to me.

716
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,150
在我查明真相之前  你需要保持低调
I need you to lay low until I get to the bottom of this.

717
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,110
同时  不要相信任何人
In the meantime, don't trust anyone.

718
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,780
还有 大坏狼… 嗯
- And, Wolf... - Yeah?

719
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,910
我们会挺过去的 好吗
We'll get through this, okay?

720
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:45,530
希望如此
I hope so.

721
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,040
嘿 我欠你一次人情
Hey. I owe you one.

722
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,580
普通朋友不就是干这个的吗
What are medium friends for, huh?

723
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,920
是的
Yeah.

724
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,470
莫琳
Maureen?

725
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,510
是 长官 取消我的预约
- Yes, ma'am? - Cancel my appointments.

726
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,010
好的 长官
You got it, ma'am.

727
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,980
我得去见一个老朋友
I've got to catch up with an old friend.

728
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,530
好消息 各位
Good news, gang.

729
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,240
黛安狐会帮我们洗清罪名
Diane's gonna help us clear our names.

730
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,280
我们只需要 保持低调 然后…
All we got to do is lay low and...

731
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,330
你
You.

732
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,840
你应该吃那片 薄荷糖的 胡子哥
You should've taken the mint, Whiskers.

733
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,220
你好 老大
Hiya, boss.

734
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,800
是的 鸡仔进烤箱了
Yeah, the chickens are in the broiler.

735
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,310
重复 鸡仔进烤箱了
Repeat, the chickens are in the broiler.

736
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,030
什么 我们…我们在哪儿
What? Where... where are we?

737
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,320
发生什么了
What's happening?

738
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:17,630
从前有一只大坏狼
Once upon a time, there was a big, bad wolf.

739
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,550
哦 我喜欢那家伙
Ooh, love that guy.

740
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,720
真是个角色
What a character.

741
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,010
他是喜欢挑战现状的狼
He's the one who challenges the status quo,

742
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,720
敢于冒险的狼
who takes the big chance.

743
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,310
没有他 天哪 我甚至觉得我们连故事都没有
Without him, shoot, I don't even think we have a story.

744
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,390
而他们叫他反派
And they call him the villain.

745
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,020
嗯 现在有点颠倒了 你不觉得吗
Hmm. Kind of backwards, don't you think?

746
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,230
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

747
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,030
他们叫我幻影大盗
They call me the Phantom Bandit.

748
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,900
我觉得名字还不赖
Nice ring to it, I guess.

749
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,740
不过你可以叫我凯蒂豹
But you can call me Kitty Kat.

750
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,660
我想你见过我的姑娘们
I think you met my girls.

751
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,410
你们好 我的天
- Hello! - Holy shrimp.

752
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,790
我叫妙算猪
I'm Pigtail.

753
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,210
能痛扁我的偶像们是我的荣幸
It was great honor to kick the butts of my heroes.

754
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,040
你们的屁股比我想象的还要棒
The butts were even greater than my dreams.

755
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,090
她是你们的超级粉丝
She's a huge fan.

756
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,550
犯罪迷
Big crime nerd.

757
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,470
谢谢
Thanks.

758
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,050
我想是吧
I think.

759
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,100
哦 嘿 苏珊
Oh, hey, Susan!

760
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,550
其实…
Actually...

761
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,180
我叫毒舌鸦 呃…
- It's Doom. - Uh...

762
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,730
苏珊只是个假名
Susan is an alias.

763
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,230
-你骗了我 -没事儿 小子
- You lied to me. - That's all right, papito.

764
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,940
-你玩弄了我 -不好 伙计
- Played me. - Not cool, man.

765
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,070
-背叛了我 -嘿 嘿 听着
- Betrayed me. - Hey. Hey, listen.

766
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,900
-这只是工作需要 -你真…
- It's just business. - You're...

767
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,320
阴险 你…
- Shady. - You're...

768
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,240
阴险
Shady.

769
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,870
说出来吧 伙计
Let it out, buddy.

770
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,830
你可真是个完美的女人
You're the perfect woman!

771
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,040
她骗过了贪心蛇
She out-snaked a snake!

772
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,130
如果那不是真爱 那…
If that's not true love, well...

773
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,040
那我就不知道什么是真爱了
well, then I don't know what true love is.

774
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,760
贪心蛇…
Snake...

775
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,930
好吧 凯蒂豹 你…你介意告诉我们来这里干什么吗
Okay. Kitty, y-you mind telling us what we're doing here?

776
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,930
直截了当 我喜欢
Cutting to the chase. I like it.

777
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,270
我们在计划一件大事
We're planning something big.

778
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,980
唯一的问题是 这活对我们三个人来说太大了
Only problem: It's too big for the three of us.

779
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,440
而你们正好需要工作 我们呢 需要人手
You need work. We need extra hands.

780
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,940
都是专业人士 你懂的 身怀绝技的那种
Professionals, you know? With a specific set of skills.

781
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,570
一起干最后一票
One last job.

782
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,990
怎么说
Whatcha say?

783
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,160
我们怎么说
What do we say?

784
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,910
不 呃 简单回答就是
No, uh, is the short answer.

785
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,160
但是 嗯 我们受宠若惊
But, well, we're flattered.

786
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,330
但是 呃 唯一的问题是 你知道…
But, uh, the thing is, you know...

787
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,450
-我们现在金盆洗手了 -是的
- We're good now. - Yeah.

788
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,250
-我们不再做大盗了
We don't steal stuff anymore.

789
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,960
是的 所以如果你们要是能把我们解开
Yeah, so if you can just, you know, untie us,

790
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,420
然后 呃  我们可以自己出去
and, uh, we'll let ourselves out.

791
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,000
我们可以就此收场 怎么样
And we can just call it a noche, okay?

792
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,480
你知道吗
You know what?

793
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,820
我喜欢红色的
I love the red ones.

794
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,150
是樱桃味吗
Is it cherry?

795
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,030
是草莓味吗 我不太确定
Is it strawberry? I'm not really sure.

796
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,490
我分不清
I can never tell.

797
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,410
一种人 你懂的
It's kind of like people, you know?

798
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,290
你以为他们是某种人
You think they're one thing,

799
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:02,580
结果发现 他们完全是另一种人
but it turns out they're something else entirely.

800
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,840
黛安狐
Diane.

801
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,170
她们知道了
She knows.

802
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,590
你能想象这事 要是传出去会怎么样吗
Can you imagine if this got out?

803
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,760
州长曾是深红魔爪的秘密过往
The governor's secret past as the Crimson Paw?

804
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,180
唷 真是个丑闻
Whew. Talk about a scandal.

805
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,390
她会陷入麻烦的
She will be in the hot bubble water.

806
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,360
所以…
So...

807
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:28,320
或者我换个方式提问
Let me rephrase the question.

808
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,530
与我们合作 黛安狐的秘密就永远不会泄露
Play along, and Diane's secret is safe.

809
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:39,200
要是不合作 那么你们 还有黛安狐  所有的美好生活
Or don't, and you, Diane, the good life,

810
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,790
一切都将崩溃
it all comes crashing down.

811
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,500
你们自己选
What'll it be?

812
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,800
好吧 辣妹 什么任务
All right, hot sauce. What's the job?

813
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,230
就是那个任务
That's the job.

814
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,190
那是月亮X号火箭
That's the MoonX rocket.

815
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,570
真的假的
Seriously?

816
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,240
你最好还是相信 姑娘
You better believe it, girl.

817
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,250
为什么要偷一辆车 当你能 偷一艘巨大的火箭飞船时
Why steal a car when you can steal a big, jumbo rocket ship?

818
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,790
我觉得她是认真的
I think she's serious.

819
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,670
你们为什么要偷火箭
Why would you want to steal a rocket?

820
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,420
抢劫从来都不只是为了赃物
A heist is never just about the loot.

821
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,380
对不对 大坏狼
Isn't that right, Wolf?

822
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,670
-这是一种实力展示 -完全正确
- It's a power move. - Exactly.

823
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,260
你懂的
You get it.

824
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,930
他也懂了
He gets it.

825
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,510
好了 来吧 我们有活要干了
All right, now, come on. We got work to do.

826
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,600
那之后我们就两清了 对吧
And after that, we're square, right?

827
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,430
你会把录像给我们
You're gonna give us the video?

828
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,310
盗贼的荣誉
Thieves' honor.

829
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,650
这会很刺激的
This is gonna be gnarly.

830
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,940
好的方面
In the good way.

831
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,610
来吧 各位 我们要抢劫了
Come on, y'all. We're going on a heist.

832
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:53,400
所以 我们又变坏了吗 还是…
So, are we bad again, or...?

833
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,820
你得佩服他们
You got to hand it to them.

834
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,990
他们几乎 想到了所有事
They thought of almost everything.

835
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,410
几乎 哦 你有办法
Almost? Oh, you got an angle.

836
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,950
我总是有办法
I've always got an angle.

837
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,960
最后一票 在这之后
One last job, and after that,

838
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,460
棒棒糖小姐会后悔她曾见过我们
Little Miss Lollipop's gonna regret she ever met us.

839
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,140
州长女士
Madam Governor?

840
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,800
带我去他的牢房
Take me to his cell.

841
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,020
好 好
Well, well, well.

842
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,730
你好啊 黛安狐
Hello, Diane.

843
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,490
橘子酱
Marmalade.

844
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:40,870
世界上那么多 最高安全级别的监狱
Of all the super maximum prisons in all the world,

845
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,990
你偏偏走进我的
you had to walk into mine.

846
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,540
哦 我的天
Oh, my.

847
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,080
你看起来真像个胖纸
You look like a balloon animal.

848
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,120
我知道 好吧
I know, right?

849
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,420
今天是训练日
Today was arm day.

850
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,750
所以我看起来 格外壮硕
That's why I'm looking extra swole.

851
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,010
所以 是什么风把你吹来了
So, to what do I owe the visit?

852
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,970
我想知道犯罪现场逃逸
I wonder if it has anything to do with

853
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:01,010
是否与你那些肮脏的朋友们有关
your mangy protégés fleeing the scene of a crime.

854
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,060
你怎么知道的
How do you know about that?

855
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,720
这是我的工作
It's my job to know.

856
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,230
我是《疯狂的麦克斯纪年》 的主编
I'm the editor in chief of the Crazy Max Chronicle.

857
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,850
还负责年鉴 当然我还是匹克球队的队长
I also do yearbook, and I'm captain of the pickleball team.

858
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,730
说实话 我在这里 混得风生水起
To be honest, I'm kind of crushing it in here.

859
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,320
好吧 那祝贺你
All right, well, good for you.

860
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,190
但你对反黄金了解多少
But what do you know about MacGuffinite?

861
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,860
虚构的反黄金
MacGuffinium Fictitium.

862
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,700
有趣的金属

863
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,700
拥有极其独特的性质
With one extremely unique property.

864
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,330
是什么
And that is?

865
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,040
嗯 我不会就这么告诉你的 对吧
Well, I'm not just gonna tell you, am I?

866
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,340
你忘了吗
Did you forget?

867
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,460
我是因为你的罪行才坐牢的
I'm sitting in prison for your crimes.

868
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,760
所以 告诉你对我有什么好处
So what's in it for me?

869
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,380
我不会给你特赦的
I am not giving you a pardon.

870
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,930
特赦
A pardon?

871
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,930
在匹克球赛季季中吗
In the middle of pickleball season?

872
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,640
不 我有个更好的主意
No. I have a better idea.

873
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,020
你想不想玩个游戏
How would you like to play a game?

874
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,570
你想让我玩什么恶心的游戏…
What sort of sick game do you want me to...

875
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,820
背叛州长的先来
Backstabbing governors first.

876
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,820
哦 太好了
Oh, goody.

877
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,330
好了 各位 听好了
All right, everyone, listen up.

878
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:09,250
你们每个人都 有特定的角色要扮演
Each of you has a specific part to play.

879
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,040
开锁工具
Safecracking gear!

880
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,670
伪装
Disguises!

881
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,090
欢迎 骇客蛛
Welcome, Ms. Tarantula.

882
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,260
哇哦 这装备可真够专业的
Whoa, that is some serious tech.

883
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,760
呃 我想我拿错包了
Uh, I think I got the wrong bag.

884
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,680
是啊 这似乎不是潜入一个发射场的
Yeah, this doesn't seem like proper attire

885
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,550
合适服装
to infiltrate a launch site.

886
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,850
哦 不
Oh, no.

887
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,600
我们不去发射场
We're not going to the launch site.

888
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,930
我们找到了绕过所有级别安保的方法
We found a way to circumvent every level of security

889
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,100
可以直达火箭
leading to the rocket,

890
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,350
而它就在月亮先生的手腕上
and it's right there on Mr. Moon's wrist.

891
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,060
手表可以控制一切
Watch controls everything,

892
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:39,610
从前门到任务控制中心
from front gate to mission control

893
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,030
再到发射场
to blastoff.

894
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,580
偷走手表就等于偷走了火箭
Steal the watch, steal the rocket.

895
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,790
唯一的问题是他从不摘下来
Only problem? He never takes it off.

896
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:51,040
幸运的是我们有举世闻名的大盗
Lucky we have world-famous pickpocket.

897
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,000
我们觉得有个好时机
And we think there's a window.

898
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,580
“耶利米·月亮邀请您 参加他的独家
"Jeremiah Moon invites you to his exclusive,

899
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:56,960
顶尖的婚礼 ”
state-of-the-art wedding."

900
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
你认真的吗 我们要去搅乱婚礼
Are you serious? We're gonna crash the wedding?

901
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,380
哦 我喜欢婚礼
Oh, I love weddings!

902
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,720
我的意思是 你知道 我喜
I mean, you know-- I li--

903
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,470
我的意思是 我喜欢它们 它们挺好的 我不在乎
I mean, I like them. They're fine. I don't care.

904
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,260
无所谓 没人关心
Whatever. No one cares.

905
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,180
嗯…计划是这样的
Um... here's how it's gonna go.

906
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,480
这是一个非常特别的活动
This is a highly exclusive event,

907
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,610
而且有高规格的安保措施
and it's got protection to match.

908
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:20,070
所以我们必须干的有创意
So, we'll have to get creative.

909
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,690
我有点生疏了 但我保证
I'm a little rusty, but I promise

910
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,610
会尊重地对待你
to play you respectfully.

911
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,160
我的天
Mamma mia!

912
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,450
我的花呢
Where's-a my flowers?

913
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:30,200
不客气 卡布奇诺 超大杯
Prego! Cappuccino! Extra grande!

914
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,330
水果沙拉 柠檬酒
Tutti frutti! Limoncello!

915
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,370
哦 那个头纱 是中古的
Oh, the veil? It's vintage.

916
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,670
一位公主戴过
A princess wore it.

917
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,380
耶利米 哦 你在这里啊
Jeremiah! Oh, there you are.

918
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,840
月亮戴着一副
Moon wears a pair of

919
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,920
AR增强眼镜  可以识别
AR-enhancement glasses that identify

920
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,420
值得交谈的人
the people worth talking to.

921
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,510
和不值得的人
And the people who aren't.

922
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,600
但…但我可是他的阿姨
But-but I'm his aunt!

923
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,220
那些合格的人可以获得
Those who make the grade earn

924
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,680
与月亮先生60秒面对面的谈话机会 -耶利米
a 60-second one-on-one with Mr. Moon. -Jeremiah.

925
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,140
那是我们的机会
That's our window.

926
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,520
我们唯一的机会
Our only window.

927
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,560
但等到一旦仪式开始
Once the ceremony begins,

928
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,770
机会就没了
it's over.

929
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,030
好了 各位 我已经看到了
All right, everyone. I got eyes.

930
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,860
食人鱼 你可以行动了
Piranha, you're a go.

931
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,990
嘿 克拉伦斯 嗯

932

这后备箱里 有点不对劲
Something doesn't look right in this trunk.

933
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,700

Uh, I don't see anything. -Yeah. No, no, no.

936
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,250
我想如果你把头 伸进去
I think if you put your head in there.

937
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,540
哦 克拉伦斯
Oh, Clarence.

938
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,380
这里一切正常
All clear here.

939
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:25,970
钛合金三重弹簧连放

940

941

你确定你还行吗  贪心蛇宝贝
You're sure you still got this, Snakey Cakes?

942
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,390
拜托
Please.

943
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,350
开锁就像谈恋爱
Lock picking is like a romance.

944
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,730
开始时 你得温柔 p幽默
You got to start gentle, playful,

945
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,820
慢慢敲开它那冰冷的心

直到所有防御都融化

949
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,750

大坏狼先生 该你了
Mr. Wolf, that's your cue.

958
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,610
别一下子 花光了 听见没
Don't spend it all in one place, you hear?

959
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,530
那是我的工作
That's my job.

960
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:37,330
嘿 下午好 你好 女士

你的目标在十二点钟方向

Someone needs to tell Marco that a shark ate him.

1021

1022

谁准备好结婚了
Who's ready to get married?

1023
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,560
美肚鲨 我是个爱慌张的人

这整件事都完蛋了
This whole thing's a bust!

1027
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,190
你失去了你的优势
You lost your edge.

1028
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,780
现在州长要为此付出代价了
And now the governor's gonna pay for it.

1029
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:16,610
嘿 别做什么傻事 好吗
Hey, let's not do anything crazy, okay?

索利曼 你以为 你是谁
Soliman, who do you think you are?

1058
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:16,400
月亮 看看 你要娶的是什么

- There were claws! I saw claws! - Get him out of here now!

1064

绝对是坏蛋联盟 史上前五的抢劫
Definitely top five Bad Guys heist ever!

1069
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,100
当那个大个子说 “我反对 ”
When big man say, "I object,"

1070
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,230
我差点尿裤子

1071
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,440

00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,780
差点
Almost.

1073
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,280
大坏狼 我…我得问一下
Wolf, I-I got to ask.

1074
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,150
你怎么知道 那会成功
How'd you know that was gonna work?

1075
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,740
你看 凯蒂豹 每个骗局 都有三个部分
You see, Kitty, there's three parts to every con.

1076
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,460
首先 设下诱饵
First, bait the hook.

1077
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,880
看
Look.

1078
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,090
然后是转折
Then comes the turn.

1079
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:24,550
有反常
Something weird is going on.

1080
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,970
应该有人反对 我反对
- Someone should object. - I object!

1081
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,640
但如果没有最后的收尾一切都白费了 -什么
But none of it works without the payoff. -What?!

1082
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,680
因为偷手表
'Cause it's one thing

1083
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,180
是一回事…
to steal the watch...

1084
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,890
索利曼 你以为 你是谁 -
Soliman, who do you think you are? -

1085
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:35,980
抓紧了 美人
Hold on tight, bellissima.

1086
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,610
…而另一回事就是要成功逃脱
...and another to get away with it.

1087
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:43,820
大坏狼
The Big Bad Wolf!

1088
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,450
这是声东击西的艺术
The art of misdirection.

1089
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:49,410
重点不是行动  是分散注意力 明白了
It's not the action, it's the distraction. Got it.

1090
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:50,990
是的 长官
Yes, ma'am.

1091
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,830
好吧 我看到你了
All right, I see you.

1092

No. Not there.

1095
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,470
不 也许…
No. Maybe...

1096
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,180
哦 好多选择 哦 我的天
- Oh, so many options. - Oh, my goodness.

1097
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,980
我们能快点吗
Can we move this along?

1098
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,190
耐心点 黛安狐
Patience, Diane.

1099
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,560
这是一个充满细节策略
This is a game of subtle strategy

1100
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,820
和心理耐受力考验的游戏
and psychological endurance mastered only by

1101
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,530
只有最狡猾和最老练的头脑才能掌握
the most cunning and sophisticated minds.

1102
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,450
“六岁及以上适用 ”
"Ages six and up."

1103
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,530
再说 也不是每天都有州长
Besides, it's not every day that the governor

1104
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:33,410
来聊量子磁性
drops by to chat about quantum ferromagnetism.

1105
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:39,500
量子 等等 你是说反黄金有磁性
Quantu-- Wait, are you saying MacGuffinite is magnetic?

1106
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,210
不只是一块磁铁
Not just a magnet.

1107
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,130
反黄金是金子的原子逆物质
MacGuffinite is the atomic inverse of gold.

1108
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,380
暴露在极高电压下…
Exposed to extreme voltage...

1109
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,300
它会导致金电子发生解耦反应
It will cause gold electrons to decouple

1110
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,220
并以惊人的力量相互吸引
and attract with spectacular force.

1111
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,890
原来它是个吸金磁铁
It's a gold magnet.

1112
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,890
哦 开始明白了
Oh, she's catching on.

1113
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:57,390
很好
Very good.

1114
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:01,560
当你都能让金子自己来找你 你又何必要去抢银行
Why rob a bank when you can make the gold come to you?

1115
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:05,190
所有的犯罪变成了零运动
All the crime, none of the exercise.

1116
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,110
-谢谢 教授 -哇 哇
- Uh, thanks, Professor. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1117
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,070
你不能走 我们还没结束…
You can't go. We haven't finished our...

1118
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,660
-什么 -不 但是怎么会
What? No! But how?!

1119
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,660
这明明是井字棋
It's literally tic-tac-toe.

1120
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,580
把你的年鉴寄给我
Send me your yearbook?

1121
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,460
你知道 这挺有意思的
You know, it's funny.

1122
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,290
你是第二个 大老远跑来这里
You're the second person to come all the way here

1123
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,170
问我关于反黄金的人
to ask me about MacGuffinite.

1124
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,590
真巧
What are the odds?

1125
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,300
还有别人来过吗
You had a visitor?

1126
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,720
我不知道她的名字
I didn't get her name,

1127
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,720
但显然我们有个共同的朋友
but apparently we have a friend in common.

1128
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:39,850
或者我应该说…五个
Or should I say... five?

1129
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,650
州长女士
Madam Governor.

1130
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:53,660
我需要橘子酱 上一个访客的录像 马上
I need footage of Marmalade's last visitor. Now.

1131
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,970
找到了
Found ya.

1132
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,030
但我能开车吗 不行 -
- But can I drive? - No. -

1133
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,530
这是我生命中 最棒的一天
This was new best day of my life.

1134
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,820
你为什么要永远离开 哦
- Why must you leave forever? - Aw.

1135
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,990
振作点 黄油猪 黄油猪
- Cheer up, Buttersnout. - Buttersnout?

1136
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:38,870
我一直想要个绰号
- I always wanted a nickname. - Oh.

1137
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:40,250
呃 太好了
Uh, great.

1138
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,460
嘿 听着 呃 对于那件事 别有芥蒂
Hey, listen, uh, no hard feelings about the whole,

1139
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,790
你知道 假装谈恋爱
you know, pretend relationship

1140
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:47,500
为了陷害你和你的朋友 好吗
to entrap you and your buddies, okay?

1141
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,420
别这样 当然不会
Come on, now. Of course not.

1142
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,800
我的意思是 说实话  我…我并不
I mean, to be honest, I-I wasn't, uh,

1143
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,180
真的那么喜欢你
really that into you.

1144
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,550
哦 奇怪了
Oh, weird.

1145
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:59,020
因为你 你看起来挺喜欢我的
'Cause you, uh, you seemed pretty into me.

1146
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,180
嗯 那是…
Well, that's...

1147
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,850
是吗
Yeah?

1148
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,900
那是 你知道 我不想 伤害你的感情
That-- You know, I didn't want to hurt your feelings,

1149
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,310
所以 呃 是啊  如果你失望了我很抱歉
so, uh, yeah, sorry if you're disappointed.

1150
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,360
哦 不 不是我
Oh, no, no, no, no, not me.

1151
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,490
你看 呃 我只有 喜欢你才会失望
You see, uh, I'd only be disappointed if I was into you,

1152
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:16,240
如前所述  我真的没有 好吗
which, uh, as previously established, I was not, okay?

1153
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,490
当然
Of course.

1154
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,540
否则  这次棉花糖敬酒
Otherwise, this marshmallow toast

1155
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,120
就会充满 浪漫的张力
would be full of romantic tension.

1156
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,380
是啊 我当然这么做了
Yeah. Of course I did.

1157
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,750
大坏狼 哦 真的吗
WOLF Oh, really?

1158
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:32,050
所以假扮新娘 是你的主意
So impersonating the bride was your idea?

1159
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,550
当然是 是啊 好的
- Absolutely. - Yeah. Okay.

1160
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,260
我雇了你
I hired you.

1161
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,850
所以 你的主意 就是我的主意
Therefore, your ideas are my ideas.

1162
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:39,180
真讲究
Classy.

1163
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,310
反黄金怎么样了
What's going on with the MacGuffinite?

1164
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:42,390
哦 只是个小小的 科学项目
Oh, just a little science project.

1165
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:45,230
啊 所以你为了科学 陷害我们
Ah. So you framed us for science?

1166
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:48,480
拜托 我必须陷害你
Come on, I had to frame you.

1167
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,150
这是唯一能把你 从退休生活中引出来的方法
It was the only way to draw you out of retirement.

1168
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:55,490
总之 你得到了 你想要的 所以 呃…
Anyway, you got what you wanted, so, uh...

1169
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,080
对了 你想要那个录像
Right. You want the video.

1170
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,040
来咯
There we go.

1171
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,540
哦 哦 天哪
- Ooh. - Oh, man.

1172
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,420
我…我有没有告诉过你 我第一次抢劫的事
Did... did I ever tell you about my first heist?

1173
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,750
呃 没有
Uh, no.

1174
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,510
嗯 是银行 珠宝店
Um, was it a bank? Jewelry store?

1175
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:17,090
棒棒糖
Lollipop.

1176
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:19,100
上学的时候 我们有个老师
Back in school, we had a teacher

1177
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,350
会给好孩子 发棒棒糖
who used to give the good kids a lollipop.

1178
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:25,350
也许是因为我的爪子或者牙齿
And maybe it was my claws or my teeth,

1179
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:28,650
但她从来 从来没有正眼看过我
but she never, ever looked my way.

1180
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,360
这很伤人
It was hurtful.

1181
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,070
所以有一天 我趁那个老家伙不注意的时候
So one day, when the old fart wasn't looking,

1182
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:37,070
我溜进抽屉 偷了整整一袋
I snuck into the drawer and swiped the whole bag.

1183
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:39,280
那之后
After that,

1184
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,450
孩子们想要棒棒糖时  就来找我
when the kids wanted lollipops, they came to me.

1185
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,580
伙计 那感觉太棒了
Dude, it was amazing, man.

1186
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:49,630
我生平第一次  感觉到了权力
For the first time in my life, I felt powerful.

1187
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,090
那之后我干了一百多票
I must've pulled off a hundred jobs since then.

1188
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:57,800
你偷得越多 他们就越尊重你
And the more you steal, the more they respect you.

1189
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:02,260
为什么要放弃偷窃呢
Why would you give that up?

1190
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:08,980
你以为你装好人 遵守他们的规则
You think if you play nice and follow their rules,

1191
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:13,480
他们就会看到真正的你
they'll just see you for who you truly are.

1192
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,860
但我告诉你 他们不会
But let me tell you, they won't.

1193
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:20,530
万一坏蛋的生活才是你最好的生活呢
What if the bad life was your best life?

1194
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:23,830
我的建议是
My advice:

1195
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:28,540
别再抱有希望  享受棒棒糖吧
Stop hoping and enjoy the lollipop.

1196
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:50,020
你拿到了吗 哦 我们拿到了
- Did you get it? - Oh, we got it.

1197
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,610
拜托 我必须陷害你们
Come on, I had to frame you.

1198
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:54,360
这是唯一能把你们从退隐生活中引出来的
It was the only way to draw you out--

1199
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,860
全盘招供
Full confession.

1200
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,440
真不敢相信 她没注意到摄像头
I can't believe she didn't notice the camera.

1201
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,900
我们只需要把这个
All we need to do is get this

1202
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,700
交给警长来洗清我们的罪名 -好的
to the chief and clear our names. -All right.

1203
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,030
我们成功了 我们成功了 喔 耶
- We did it. We did it. - Whoo! Yeah!

1204
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,620
呜呼 -胜利之舞
Woo-hoo! -Touchdown dance!

1205
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:08,790
嘿 伙计
Hey, buddy.

1206
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,290
你还好吗
You okay?

1207
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,210
哦 呃 没什么
Oh. Uh, nothing.

1208
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,090
只是 呃  想象着我的下一轮
Just, uh, imagining my next round

1209
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,420
刺激的求职面试
of thrilling job interviews.

1210
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,380
大坏狼 这就是计划
Wolfie, this is the plan.

1211
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,760
是啊 不 我知道 我只是说…
Yeah. No, I know. I'm just saying...

1212
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,220
我在说什么啊
What am I saying?

1213
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,390
我只是说 万… 万一我们所有的改过自新
I'm just saying, wh-- what if we took a wrong turn

1214
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:30,020
都错了呢
with the whole going good thing?

1215
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,230
你懂我意思吧
You know what I mean?

1216
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:35,110
是啊 但这次会 不一样的
Yeah, but it's gonna be different this time.

1217
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:37,440
“抓获了幻影大盗 ”
"Captured the Phantom Bandit."

1218
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,780
那写在你简历上 会很好看
That'll look great on your résumé.

1219
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,410
我们会成为英雄的 食人鱼街
We're gonna be heroes. Piranha Street.

1220
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,740
是啊 不 是啊 完全是
Yeah, no, yeah. Totally.

1221
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,780
我在说什么啊 你说得对
What am I talking about? You're right.

1222
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,580
来吧 我们去找警长
Come on, let's find the chief.

1223
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,250
走吧 这才像话 大坏狼
- Let's go. - That's my Wolf.

1224
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:59,380
你真的以为那么简单就结束了吗
Did you really think it was gonna be that easy?

1225
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,260
该死
Shoot.

1226
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,840
嘿 -轻点
Hey! -Watch it!

1227
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,010
这里有人很淘气哦
Naughty, naughty.

1228
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:06,600
这些是金的吗
Are these gold?

1229
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,930
凯蒂豹 我们能谈谈这个吗 呃…
Kitty, can we talk about this for a second? Uh...

1230
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:11,480
不行
Nope.

1231
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,310
那是反黄金吗
Is that MacGuffinite?

1232
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,440
你是要干嘛
What's going on?

1233
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,230
让我来给你们展示一下吧
How about I show you?

1234
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,780
哦 漂亮啊
Ooh, shiny.

1235
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,460
吸金石啊
A gold magnet?

1236
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,630
还真让你猜对了
You bet your scaly butt it is.

1237
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,800
而且这只是个测试品
And this is just a prototype.

1238
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,380
在零重力下更厉害
Wait till you see what it can do in zero gravity.

1239
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,680
你要把它带到太空 废话
- You're taking it to space? - Obviously.

1240
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,390
你以为去偷大火箭干嘛的
What do you think giant rocket is for?

1241
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:49,310
又不是为了科学展
Is not for science fair.

1242
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,970
你总不能指望偷走全世界的黄金
You can't expect us to steal

1243
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,810
在这里进行吧
all the world's gold from down here.

1244
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:56,060
史上最大的抢劫
The biggest heist in history.

1245
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,560
将由我们来呈现
Courtesy of us.

1246
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,980
全世界的黄金
All the world's gold?

1247
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,980
哦 哦 还有点睛之笔
Oh. Oh. And the cherry on top!

1248
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,530
=哇 哇 -你在干什么
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

1249
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,660
那影像 你没必要毁了黛安狐
The video? You don't need to ruin Diane.

1250
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,030
让我们 让我们 来吧
Let's-- Let's-- Come on.

1251
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,620
我们好好谈谈 问题是
- Let's talk about this. - Hmm, see, thing is,

1252
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:11,490
我已经答应过那个豚鼠 会做的
I promised this rodent that I would.

1253
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,870
算是种利益交换吧
Kind of a quid pro quo type thing.

1254
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:16,210
橘子酱 我知道
- Marmalade. - I know.

1255
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:17,920
那家伙真是个怪咖
What a goofball.

1256
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,170
但科学邻域算是个天才
But a real wiz with the science stuff.

1257
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,670
要…要不这样
I-I'll tell you what.

1258
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:26,550
我们毕竟是朋友  我给你一个机会
'Cause we're friends, I'm gonna give you a choice.

1259
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:32,350
不 不 停下
No, no, no, no, no! Stop it.

1260
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:35,020
你可以用这个停下它
You can stop it with this.

1261
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:39,440
什么…
What the...

1262
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,030
上传程序是与吸金石匹配的
The upload is paired to the magnet.

1263
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:48,860
你关掉吸金石  影像就会疯传
The moment you turn it off, the video goes viral.

1264
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:52,160
或者开着它保护黛安狐
Or leave it on, protect Diane,

1265
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,660
但你们就一直吊着 直到警察到来
but y'all keep dangling until the police arrive.

1266
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,420
真是个两难的选择
Oh, such a dilemma.

1267
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:01,710
警察
The police?

1268
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,130
你好 我是局长
Hello. Commissioner speaking.

1269
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:05,510
是的 局长 我有个重要情报
Yes, ma'am. I got a hot tip.

1270
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,680
坏蛋联盟躲在
The Bad Guys are holed up in a hangar

1271
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,050
月亮X号发射场以北两公里的机库里
two klicks north of the MoonX launch site.

1272
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:11,300
什么 等…等等 你…是谁…
What? W-Wait. Wh-Who is...

1273
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:12,890
抱歉 宝贝
Sorry, doll.

1274
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:14,600
听着 这不是个人恩怨
Look, it's nothing personal.

1275
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:17,520
你现在的样子真迷蛇
You are so hot right now.

1276
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,270
贪心蛇 啥
- Snake! - Yeah?

1277
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:20,310
来吧 伙计
Come on, man.

1278
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,730
你们爬行动物真够变态的
You are one twisted reptile.

1279
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:25,780
我真想留下来看场好戏
I wish I could stick around to see how it ends,

1280
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:28,360
但我们还有火箭要偷
but we've got a rocket to steal.

1281
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,820
再见
Ciao.

1282
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:32,620
凯蒂豹 凯蒂豹 等等 等一下 求你了
Kitty. Kitty, wait. Hold on a second, please.

1283
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,080
看吧 这就是为什么我不喜欢猫
See? This is why I'm not a cat person.

1284
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,460
我们该怎么选
How are we supposed to choose?

1285
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,340
我们不用选 我不会那么容易放弃
We're not. I don't give up that easy.

1286
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,840
食人鱼 嗯
- Piranha. - Yeah?

1287
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,420
我需要你拔出u盘 听我指令
I need you to pull out the USB. Follow my lead.

1288
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:49,970

1293
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:03,730
上传速度越来越快了
And it's going faster.

1294
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:05,690
不好 改计划 重组
- Not good. - New plan. Regroup!

1295
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,680

1296
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,300
? Ay, tell 'em they can't break me, break me down ?

1297
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,680
? Ay, come on, baby, shut it down ?

1300
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,440
? Tell 'em they can never bring us down ?

1301
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,980
? Yeah, jumped off the porch since a child ?

1302
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,970
? Why they wanna push me... ?

1303
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:33,360
骇客蛛 你的腿困住了 还有足够的活动空间来黑系统吗
Webs, you got enough wiggle in those legs to hack in?

1304
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:35,010
给我三条腿就够了 差不多
Three legs is all I need. I think.

1305
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,850
那好 我们走
All right, let's go.

1306

01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,830
? All black on ?

1308
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:44,730
? Got my ski mask... ?

1309
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,130
大坏狼 大坏狼 我没黑进去
Wolf, Wolf, I can't get in.

1310
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,320
快撤 快撤
Fall back! Fall back!

1311
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,420
? Whew, girl, look at you ?

1312
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,050
? Hop up in that coupe, check the temperature ?

1313
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:57,470
? Hop up in that, hey, hey ?

1314
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,350
? Star ..., mosh pit, they can never stop ... ?

1315
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:02,730
? Got it from the mud, I ain't have no other option ?

1316
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:04,940
? Watch out for the cops, here they come ?

1317
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,940
? Gotta go ?

1318

1319
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:11,400
? They don't want the...

1320
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:14,590
? And I see why... ?

1321
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:14,580
别着急 再想一想 再想一想
Now, think, think, think, think, think, think.

1322

我们要把电脑扔进火里
We're gonna throw the whole thing into the fire.

1327
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,600
这是我们最后的机会 你行的 伙计

1333
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,600

1334
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,270
? All black on, got my ski mask ?

1335
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,720
? All black on ?

1336
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,270
? Got my ski mask ?

1337
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,650
? Hundred million ..., don't they see that? ?

1338
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:30,290
好吧 好吧
Well, well, well.

1339
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,800
没有你的热狗卡车  就不那么厉害了吧 大坏狼
Not so tough without your hot dog truck, are you, Wolf?

1340
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,810
这下梦想成真了
This is getting real.

1341
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,230
早上好 女士们

很接近了
Close enough.

1345
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:00,450
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

1346
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,490
你知道我都是亲力亲为
You know, I'm very hands-on.

1347
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,620
尤其当有人试图陷害我朋友的时候
Especially when someone tries to frame my friends.

1348
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:10,130
我什么都知道了 反黄金 吸金石

嗯 你和橘子酱谈过了

事实上大部分时间都是他一个人在说
Actually, he did most of the talking.

1351
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:17,970
我更喜欢直接动手
I'm more of an action girl.

1352
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,300
让开 否则我会让你吃尽苦头
Step aside before anger becomes punch.

1353
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:55,340
你们都被捕了
You're all under arrest.

1354

你不知道 是吗
You don't know, do you?

1357
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,350
你不再是州长了
You're not governor anymore.

1358
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,310
你可能想看看 你的手机
You might want to check your phone.

1359
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:07,810
深红魔爪

怎么 怎…怎么会
How-- H-How?

1363
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:32,670
他们从不提防飞镖
They never expect the dart.

1364
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,670
我们走吧
Shall we?

1369
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:04,070

在警方搜寻这位骗子政客的同时

被陷害且可爱的橘子酱教授
of sweet, adorable Professor Marmalade,

1373
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,590
他不像坏蛋联盟  那些家伙自称“改过自新”
unlike the Bad Guys, whose claim to have "changed"

1374
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:19,090
现在完全没人相信
fooled absolutely no one.

1375
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:21,550
警长 我们被一群 超级罪犯陷害了
Chief, we were set up by a gang of supercriminals.

1376
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,260
他们把反黄金 变成了吸金磁铁
They turned the MacGuffinite into a gold magnet.

1377
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,800
排好队 他们正在偷
- Back in line. - And they're stealing

1378
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,850
那枚火箭把它带到太空
that rocket to take it to space.

1379
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:28,720
是啊 他们都这么说
Yeah, that's what they all say.

1380
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:32,100
警长 我知道这看起来很糟  但如果真的是我们干的
Ch-Chief, I know it looks bad, but if we did this,

1381
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,600
我们为什么要帮你破案
why would we help you solve the case?

1382
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,520
我们为什么要告诉你关于反黄金的事
Why would we tell you about the MacGuffinite?

1383
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,270
而且赃物在哪儿呢 你知道这不合逻辑
And where's the loot? You know it doesn't add up.

1384
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,280
听着 我们没有证据
Look, we don't have proof,

1385
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:45,280
但我知道在你那颗强大澎湃的内心深处
but I know, somewhere in that big, booming heart of yours,

1386
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,410
你知道这不是我们干的
you know we didn't do this.

1387
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:50,290
警长 求你了
Chief, please.

1388
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,000
我要告诉你多少次  大坏狼
How many times do I have to tell you, Wolf?

1389
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,250
叫我“局长”
It's "Commissioner."

1390
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,970
准备好驾驶这个了吗
Ready to fly this thing?

1391
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:12,930
有了手表 火箭自己飞
With watch, rocket flies itself.

1392
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:21,280
嘿 珍妮 你看到这个了吗
Hey, Jenny. You seeing this?

1393
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,850
食人鱼街也别想了
So much for Piranha Street.

1394
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,660
警长
Chief?

1395
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,790
好吧 假设  我假设我相信你们
Okay, let's say, hypothetically, I believe you--

1396
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:16,290
但我并不信
Which I don't.

1397
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:19,630
但如果我信…如果我信真的有某个超级罪犯
But if I did... if I did and some supercriminal

1398
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:22,880
拥有一个吸金磁铁  那我们怎么阻止他们
has a gold magnet, how would we stop them?

1399
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,420
你…你相信我们
You... you believe us?

1400
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,260
不 不
No! No, no, no!

1401
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,600

No! No!

1402
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,140
我想给她一个拥抱
I want to give her a hug.

1403
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,560
哦 我喜欢警长
Ooh, I like Chief.

1404
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,810
警长  那是新洗发水吗
Ooh, wow, Chief, is that a new shampoo?

1405
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:41,230
好了 好了
Okay, okay.

1406
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:42,900
请不要再摸了
Please stop with the touching.

1407
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,440
我搞不懂你们
I don't get you guys.

1408
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,150
你们是好人 然后是坏人 然后又有点像好人
You're good, then you're bad, then you're sort of good,

1409
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:47,740
然后又是十足的坏人
then really bad.

1410
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:49,320
呃 真难跟上你们的节奏
Ugh, it's hard to keep up!

1411
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,910
是的 是的 这很正常
Yep, yep. That's fair.

1412
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,780
我明白 我们变化无常
I get it. We're all over the place.

1413
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:56,620
但你得在那枚火箭起飞前 把我们送到那里
But you need to get us to that rocket before it takes off.

1414
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:59,790
火箭 什…什么 你说什么
Rocket? What-what are you talking about?

1415
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:03,250
开始倒数
Initiating backwards counting.

1416
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,800
倒计时已启动
Countdown initiated.

1417
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,050
倒计时已启动 哇哦 怎么回事
Countdown initiated? Whoa. What's going on?

1418
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:10,090
我不知道 嗯 关掉它 珍妮
- I don't know. - Well, shut it down, Jenny!

1419
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:12,180
关掉它 我在试 吉姆
- Shut it down! - I'm trying, Jim!

1420
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:13,430

1421
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,140
呃 我们有点 小状况
Uh, we've got a slight situation.

1422
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:16,680
发射不是要到 下周才
The launch isn't until next wee--

1423
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:23,520
嗯 我的天哪
Well, butter my crumpets.

1424
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,450
五 四…
Five, four...

呜呼
Woo-hoo!

1428
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,850
反转接二连三
The twists just keep coming.

1429
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:01,600
月亮X号火箭似乎 提前三天起飞了
The MoonX rocket seems to have taken off three days early--

1430
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,150
搞什么鬼
What the hairbrush?

1431
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,200
放马过来
Bring it on!

1432
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:33,680
我的天哪
Holy moly.

1433
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:38,810
你确定要这么做
Are you sure about this?!

1434
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:41,020
不是很确定 不
Not particularly. No.

1435
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:45,020
记住 当你们回来时  你们都被捕了
Remember, when you come back, you're under arrest!

1436
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:48,690

- Woo-hoo! - We did it!

1446
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,910
我们还没成功
We didn't do it.

1447
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,620

01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:26,290
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?!

1454
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:28,460
左松右紧
Lefty-loosey, righty-tighty.

1455
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:32,250
哦 对了
Oh, right.

1456
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,460
那是什么
What is it?

1457
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:41,470
啊 没关系 只是个小故障
Ah, never mind. Just glitch.

1458
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,650
景色真美
Now, that is a view.

1459
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,990
怎么回事
What is happening?!

1460
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:02,030
先生 他们正前往 多国空间站
Sir, they're heading to the Multinational Space Station.

1461
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:03,490
我想他们正在对接
I think they're docking.

1462
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,470
毒舌鸦 你跟我来
Doom, you're with me.

1463
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,350
妙算猪 把反黄金放好
Pigtail, get the MacGuffinite in place.

1464
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,390

You got it, Kitty.

1465

有人在家吗
Yoo-hoo. Anybody home?

1466
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,030
装修不错
Ooh, nice decor.

1467
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,950
非常有太空感
Very, uh, space-y.

1468
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:55,590
现在想想 刚才有点鲁莽了
In hindsight, that was a little reckless.

1469
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:57,300
大家都没事吧
Did everybody make it?

1470
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,170
嘿 食…食人鱼呢

我会飞了
I can fly!

1472
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:06,260
我只需要相信 自己 哈
I just needed to believe in myself. Ha!

1473
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:12,230
哦 你… 你们也会飞
Oh, you... you guys can fly, too?

1474
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:17,070

All right, watch the legs.

1475
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:19,570
哇哦 伙计们 看这个
Whoa. Guys, check this out.

1476
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:22,030
她在干什么
What is she doing?

1477
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,750
他们正在使用 月亮X号能量电池
They're using the MoonX Power Cell

1478
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,250
来激活反黄金
to activate the MacGuffinite.

1479
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:40,590
真是天才
Kind of genius.

1480
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:47,890
是啊 他们很聪明
Yeah, they're smart,

1481
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:49,930
但有件事他们没料到
but there's something they didn't count on.

1482
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,480
我有个计划
I got a plan.

1483
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:58,610
安装完成
Mm-hmm. Installation complete.

1484
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:01,280
确认坐标
Confirming coordinates.

1485
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,340
我们不该…呃…为这个接受些特殊训练吗
Shouldn't we, uh, get some special training for this?

1486
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:23,050
别…别往下看就行
Just don't-don't look down.

1487
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,970
呃 追加一个问题：哪边是下
Uh, follow-up question: Which way is down?

1488
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,140
听好了
Listen up.

1489
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:31,720
这全靠时机
This is all about timing.

1490
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,060
骇客蛛 美肚鲨 我需要你们黑进外部控制台
Webs, Shark, I need you to hack the external console

1491
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:37,480
同时贪心蛇和食人鱼打开控制面板启动
while Snake and Piranha pop the control panel to engage

1492
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,110
手动超控开关 知道了
- the manual override switch. - You got it.

1493
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:42,320
那凯蒂豹呢 她交给我
- And what about Kitty? - Leave her to me.

1494
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,990
我们只有一次机会拯救世界
We got one shot to save the world.

1495
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:45,910
别搞砸了
Let's make it count.

1496
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:49,030
好了 伙计 你能行的
Okay, buddy. You can do this.

1497
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:51,330
首先 清空根目录 嗯哼
- First, clear the root folder. - Mm-hmm.

1498
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:53,040
然后在系统目录里输入
Then in system directory, type

1499
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,370
“ENC_word=word.encode”
"ENC underscore word equals word dot encode." -Mm-hmm.

1500
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:57,040
现在输入“import hashlib”
Now "import hashlib."

1501
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,460
嗯哼 按回车
- Mm-hmm. - Hit enter.

1502
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,210
然后是“input_path=input”
Then "input underscore path equals input."

1503
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:02,460
好的 酷 酷 知道了
Okay. Cool, cool. Got it.

1504
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:06,800
好的 所以 你说清空根目录
Okay, so, clear the root folder, you say.

1505
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:11,050
好了 来吧 来吧 食人鱼
Okay, come on. Come on, Piranha.

1506
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,560
你不紧张 对吧
You're not nervous, right?

1507
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,930
因为我们知道你紧张时会发生什么
'Cause we know what happens when you're nervous.

1508
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:18,190
我…我有什么好紧张的
Wh-What would I be nervous about?

1509
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:21,400
哦 食人鱼
Oh. Piranha!

1510
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,400
伙计 抱歉
- Dude! - Sorry.

1511
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,030
我能尝到
I can taste it.

1512
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:29,660
我们已就位
We're in position.

1513
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:32,870
我想是时候我们该自我介绍了
I think it's time we introduced ourselves.

1514
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,440
? People, people, dancing on the people... ?

1515
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:44,940
? People, people... ?

1516
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,700
? Everybody... ?

1517
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:56,450
? Apart from you ?

1518
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:59,120
? Now that we're dancing ?

1519
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,960
? People ?

1520
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,080
? Dancing people ?

1521
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,460
? Dancing people... ?

1522
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:07,530
哦 谢谢
Oh. Thank you.

1523
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,780
哦 谢谢
Oh. Thank you.

1524
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,120
怎么回事 我怎么在飞
What's going on? Why am I flying?

1525
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:33,760
我的天哪
Holy potatoes.

1526
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,390
居然真的有用
It's actually working.

1527
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:36,720
哦 耶
Ooh, yeah!

1528
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:39,850
哦 天哪
Oh, boy.

1529
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:42,350
我们怎么样了 贪心蛇 等一下
- How we doing, Snake? - Hang on.

1530
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,560
搞定了
Got it!

1531
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,440
就像偷糖果和一个婴儿
Like stealing candy and a baby.

1532
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,820
你不是想说“从婴儿手里偷糖果”吗
Don't you mean "candy from a baby"?

1533
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,610
我知道我说了什么
I know what I said.

1534
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:51,950
气闸门怎么样了
How about the air lock?

1535
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:57,370
好了 骇客蛛 我喜欢你的风格
All right, Webs. I like your style.

1536
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:59,450
哦 那个全是美肚鲨干的
Oh, that one was all Shark.

1537
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,790
我慌了
I panicked.

1538
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:02,790
但结果不错 我现在是程序员了
But it worked out. I'm a programmer now.

1539
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:04,960
我进去了
I'm going in.

1540
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,470
那是什么 啊
- What was that? - Huh?

1541
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:15,010
哦 那可不妙
Oh, that's not good.

1542
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,230
贪心蛇 伙计 对不起
Snake, buddy, I'm sorry.

1543
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:26,520
什么 不 不…
What? No, no, no...

1544
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,780
我恨你
I hate you.

1545
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,490
去气闸门
Get to the air lock!

1546
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:38,120
走 走
Go, go, go!

1547
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,130
姑娘们 现在没什么能阻止我们了
Girls, nothing gonna stop us now.

1548
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:54,180
贪心蛇宝贝
Snakey Cakes?

1549
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:57,300
救…我
Help... me.

1550
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:01,680
别放屁了 你这个疯子
Stop farting, you maniac!

1551
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,180
哇 哇 别这样
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on.

1552
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:05,810
关掉它 好吗 你会杀了他们的
Turn it off, all right? You're gonna kill them.

1553
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:08,110
不好意思 你站哪边的
I'm sorry. Whose side are you on?

1554
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,360
凯蒂豹 住手 这只是次抢劫
Kitty, stop! It's just a heist.

1555
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,450
抢劫从来都不只是抢劫
It's never just a heist!

1556
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:17,700
锁住气闸门 现在
Secure the air lock. Now.

1557
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:20,030
遵命 老大
Whatever you say, boss.

1558
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,960
“关掉它 ”
"Turn it off."

1559
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,970
哈 我才刚开始呢
Ha! I'm just getting started.

1560
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:54,360
这简直是彻底的混乱
It is total mayhem!

1561
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,360
一场灾难性的黄金风暴简直在摧毁这座城市
A cataclysmic gold storm is literally destroying the city!

1562
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,080
哦 耶
Oh, yeah.

1563
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,420
黄金
The gold.

1564
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,790
来妈妈这儿
Come to mama.

1565
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:10,670
你知道 我一直在想 -
You know, I've been thinking. -

1566
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:11,960
大坏狼
Wolf?

1567
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:14,010
那个词听起来不是有点像编的吗
Doesn't that word sound kind of made-up?

1568
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:15,590
“黄金 ”有点怪 对吧
"Gold." It's kind of weird, right?

1569
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:17,590
很怪 很怪 这是个很怪的词
- It's weird. It's weird-- It's a weird word.

1570
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:20,430
来吧 说…说 “黄金 ”
Go ahead. S-Say, say, "Gold."

1571
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:23,720
黄金 黄金 黄金
Gold. Gold. Gold.

1572
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,100
总之 不重要了
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

1573
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,940
我需要你关掉磁铁
I'm gonna need you to turn off the magnet.

1574
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:29,850
或者我帮你关
Or I'll just do it for you.

1575
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:32,360
这很好笑吗
Is that supposed to be funny?

1576
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:42,830
坚持住 伙计
Stay with me, papo.

1577
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:44,120
坚持住
Stay with me!

1578
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,620
我…我不想这么死
I-I don't want to die like this.

1579
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:58,130
好了 好了
Okay, okay.

1580
01:23:58,130 --> 01:23:59,970
来吧 食人鱼 你的朋友在太空中打转
Come on, Piranha, your friend is spinning out in space.

1581
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:02,220
你应该知道该怎么做
You should know what to do.

1582
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:04,930
对了 那支笔
That's it! The pen!

1583
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:06,390
那支笔 什么…
The pen? Wha...

1584
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:08,730
抓住那支笔 那支笔 抓住… -
Grab the pen! The pen! Grab the... -

1585
01:24:08,730 --> 01:24:10,480
哦 不 不
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1586
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,570
好的 我能做点事 我能做点事
Okay, I can do stuff. I can do stuff.

1587
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:27,410
你为什么要冒着生命危险去救那些甚至不给你
Why would you risk your life to save people who wouldn't even

1588
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:29,000
机会的人
give you a chance?

1589
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:35,880
至少当你还是大坏狼的时候  他们尊重你
At least when you were the Big Bad Wolf, they respected you.

1590
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,670
哦 那是尊重 嗯
Oh, that was respect, huh?

1591
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:40,340
那不是尊重 那是恐惧
That wasn't respect. That was fear.

1592
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:42,510
哦 无所谓 伙计
Oh, whatever, man.

1593
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,760
有什么区别
What's the difference?

1594
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,010
相信我 有区别
Trust me, there's a difference.

1595
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,930
尊重是赢得的
Respect is earned.

1596
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:50,190
总有一天 你会明白的
One day, you'll learn that.

1597
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:16,130
说真的 大坏狼 你凭什么觉得这会成功
Honestly, Wolf, what made you think this would work?

1598
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:18,880
谁说没成功
Who says it didn't?

1599
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,130
就像你说的 重点不是行动
Like you said, it's not about the action.

1600
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:24,090
是分散注意力
It's about the distraction.

1601
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:31,230
嘿 天才 手表控制的是穿梭机  不是磁铁
Hey, genius, the watch controls the shuttle, not the magnet.

1602
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:33,600
你懂的
You get it.

1603
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,400
她懂的
She gets it.

1604
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,740
拿到了
Got it!

1605
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:48,530
你确定吗
You sure about this?

1606
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,700
相信我 小子
Trust me, chico.

1607
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,750
金枪鱼之力
Tuna power!

1608
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:04,130
我拿到了
I got it!

1609
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:09,510
干得好 伙计们 骇客蛛 告诉我你准备好了
Well done, boys. Webs, tell me you're ready.

1610
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,140
正在对准 大坏狼
Lining it up, Wolfie.

1611
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:16,400
干得不错 孩子
Nice work, kid.

1612
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,480
不
No.

1613
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:20,070
你想看实力展示吗 凯蒂豹
You want to see a power move, Kitty?

1614
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:22,780
这才是实力展示
This is a power move.

1615
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,980
没事
It's fine.

1616
01:26:57,810 --> 01:26:59,310
啊 喂
- -Huh? - Hello!

1617
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:02,820
需要帮忙吗 我来帮你 贪心蛇宝贝
- Need a hand? - I got you, Snakey Cakes.

1618
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:05,150
哦 甜心鸟
Oh, Sugar Beak.

1619
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:08,570
你还说你不喜欢我
And you said you weren't into me.

1620
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:12,830
你为什么会相信我说的任何话
Why would you believe anything I say?

1621
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:15,210
不
No!

1622
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:20,630
没有穿梭机 你怎么回地球
How do you expect to get back to Earth without a shuttle?!

1623
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:22,920
至少还有个地球可以回去…
At least there's an Earth to go back...

1624
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,970
你毁了我的完美计划
You destroyed my beautiful plan!

1625
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:50,200
我告诉过你别惹我朋友了吧
What did I tell you about messing with my friends?

1626
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,030
什…你怎么… 大坏狼 我们拿…哦
- Wha-- How did you... - Wolf, we got-- Oh.

1627
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,300
我们试过阻止她发…
We tried to stop her from posting...

1628
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:14,470
啊 哇哦 中等友好关系怎么了
Ah, wow. What happened to medium friendly?

1629
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:17,810
嗯 幸好我不再是州长了 对吧
Well, good thing I'm not the governor anymore, huh?

1630
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,400
呃 恶心
Ugh, gross.

1631
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,400
是时候了 伙计们
- 'Bout time. - Guys!

1632
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,570
哇哦 黛安狐
Whoa! Diane.

1633
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:27,070
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

1634
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:28,780
碰巧在绕地球轨道飞行
Just happened to be orbiting the Earth.

1635
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:29,950
想着顺道来看看
Thought I'd drop by.

1636
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:31,660
呜呼 -耶
Woo-hoo! -Yeah!

1637
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:33,320
我们成功了 宝贝
We did it, baby.

1638
01:28:33,330 --> 01:28:34,780
我感受到了爱 真的 我感受到了
I feel the love. Like, I feel it.

1639
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:38,410
我这辈子都在听说著名的坏蛋联盟
I hear about the famous Bad Guys all my life.

1640
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:40,540
但现在我明白了
But now I get it.

1641
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,590
警报
Alert.

1642
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:49,590
警报
Alert.

1643
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,930
警报
Alert.

1644
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,930
系统大规模故障 警报
- It is a massive system failure. - Alert.

1645
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:57,930
我们正在脱离轨道
We're falling out of orbit.

1646
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,110
我想就到这了 大坏狼
I think this is it, Wolfie.

1647
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:11,150
我们完蛋了
We're doomed!

1648
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,450
最后拥抱一下 各位
One last hug, everybody?

1649
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:14,490
哇 哇 哇 哇 哇 等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

1650
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:16,240
别那么说
Don't talk like that.

1651
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:19,950
当然 这…看起来…是的 很糟
Sure, it's-- it looks-- yeah, it's bad.

1652
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,750
是啊 好吧 很糟
Yeah, okay. It's bad.

1653
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,580
当然 我们正坐着一个铁罐子冲向地球
Sure, we're hurtling towards Earth in a tin can,

1654
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,210
直面死亡
staring squarely into the face of death.

1655
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:27,800
当然 我们的血液可能会沸腾 骨骼可能会液化
Sure, our blood may boil, our bones may liquefy,

1656
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,630
但如果我了解这个团队的一件事
but if there's one thing that I know about this crew,

1657
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:34,760
那就是我们永不 永不放弃
it's that we never, ever give up.

1658
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:38,260
因为我们拥有比恐惧更强大的东西
Because we have something that's stronger than fear,

1659
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:40,640
甚至比重力更强大
stronger than even gravity.

1660
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:41,980
那就是希望
And that's hope.

1661
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,850
是啊 希望
Yeah, hope.

1662
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:45,480
那就是希望
That's hope.

1663
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,230
我们要把这东西降落…
We're gonna land this thing...

1664
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:51,650
…或者我们会死在尝试上
...or we're gonna die tryi--

1665
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:01,700
那些家伙
What those guys,

1666
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:04,580
那些勇敢 美丽的家伙在上面所做的
those brave, beautiful guys did up there,

1667
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:09,500
将世界从一场24K金的大灾难中拯救出来
saving the world from a 24-karat catastrophe.

1668
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,920
尽管遭受了所有的拒绝和怀疑
And despite all the rejection and suspicion,

1669
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:17,720
所有微小的羞辱 他们都是为了我们做的
all the tiny humiliations, they did it for us.

1670
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,560
他们不是为了名声或荣耀
They didn't do it for the fame or for the glory.

1671
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,480
他们是为了我们
They did it for us.

1672
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,770
他们不仅仅是好人
They weren't just good guys.

1673
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:29,230
他们是我最好的朋友
They were my best friends.

1674
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:32,240
我愿意付出一切 只为再逮捕他们
And I would give anything to arrest them

1675
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,450
一次
just one more time.

1676
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:42,660
这个敬你 大坏狼
This one's for you, Wolfie!

1677
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:50,210
我个人感到愤怒 居然要等到一个邪恶的太空磁铁
I, for one, am outraged that it took an evil space magnet

1678
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:52,670
才让人们意识到坏蛋联盟
for people to realize that the Bad Guys

1679
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:55,680
一直都值得我们去爱
were worthy of our love all along.

1680
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:58,760
但现在太晚了 因为他们已经死了
But it's too late, because now they're dead.

1681
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:02,720
讽刺的是劫案的
Ironically, the only survivors

1682
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:04,560
唯一的幸存者
were the perpetrators of the heist,

1683
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,850
包括被称为幻影大盗的超级罪犯
including the supercriminal known as the Phantom Bandit,

1684
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:11,650
而不幸的是第二个逃生舱是空的
while a second escape pod was, tragically, empty.

1685
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:25,960
我演得怎么样
Did I sell it or did I sell it?

1686
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:28,620
你要告诉我们这到底是怎么回事吗
Are you gonna tell us what this is all about?

1687
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:30,330
是啊 因为我没感觉自己会死
Yeah, 'cause I don't feel dead.

1688
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:31,750
那些穿西装的是谁
And who are the suits?

1689
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:35,050
为什么还要在室内戴墨镜
And why are they wearing sunglasses inside?

1690
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:39,720
我知道 我知道这看起来很复杂 但相信我
I know. I know it seems elaborate, but trust me,

1691
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:43,810
如果你想做些真正的好事 这就是最好的方法
it's the best way if you want to do some serious good.

1692
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:45,770
先生们 女士们
Gentlemen. Ladies.

1693
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:48,440
你们已被确定为加入一个全新的
You have been identified as ideal candidates

1694
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:51,310
超精英的秘密特工组织的理想人选
for a brand-new, ultra-elite unit of secret operatives

1695
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,730
我们称之为
that we're calling the International

1696
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:56,240
国际超星系守护者联盟
Super-Galactic League of Protectors:

1697
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:58,570
超联
ISGLOP.

1698
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:00,950
这名字听起来有点像编出来的
- Huh? - Sounds kind of made-up.

1699
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:03,080
我…我不明白 现在什么情况
I-I don't understand. What-What's happening?

1700
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,410
你们有新身份了 孩子们
We're offering you a job, son.

1701
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:07,460
你们要当秘密特工了
You're gonna be secret agents!

1702
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:10,460
认真的吗 不可能吧
- Is he serious? - That can't be right.

1703
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:12,460
秘密特工 别开玩笑了
Secret agents? Get out of here.

1704
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,750
他们好像是认真的 真的吗 我就说嘛
- They're serious? Really? - That's what I'm talking about!

1705
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,630
-太好了 没问题
- Woo-hoo! -Nice. - All right.

1706
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,580
嘿 差点忘了你还在
Hey. Almost forgot you were there.

1707
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,660
你可能已经注意到了 改变并不容易
As you might have noticed, change isn't easy.

1708
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:51,460
有时候你会感觉自己完全没有希望了
Some days, it's gonna feel downright hopeless.

1709
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,580
但只要有好心态
But with the right attitude

1710
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:55,840
和好朋友
and the right friends,

1711
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,340
总有一天 美好的生活会来临的
the good life has a way of finding you.

1712
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:02,010
准备好开工了吗 大坏狼特工
Ready to get to work, Agent Wolf?

1713
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:03,800
这样也不错
Not bad.

1714
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,010
一点都不错
Not bad at all.

1715
01:33:05,010 --> 01:33:15,700
别走开 精彩继续

1716
01:33:05,010 --> 01:33:15,700
Power by Love
Beta

1717
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,210
? I feel lucky, and I feel blessed ?

1718
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:22,800
? The sun is shining, so take a breath ?

1719
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,470
? Of the good life, good life ?

1720
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:28,060
? We heading for the good life ?

1721
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,350
? Good li-i-i-ife ?

1722
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:33,230
? Cool breeze blowing away my cares ?

1723
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:38,190
? 'Cause where we're going, it's in the air ?

1724
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:40,150
? It's the good life, good life ?

1725
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:42,740
? We heading for the good life ?

1726
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:45,110
? Good li-i-i-ife ?

1727
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:49,120
? Oh, so good, just the way it should be ?

1728
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,080
? Told you that it could be, told you that we would be ?

1729
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:55,040
? Heading for some new heights ?

1730
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,420
? Heading for the high life ?

1731
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:58,000
? Feels like we just took flight ?

1732
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,960
? We on a joyride ?

1733
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,760
? Never doubted we were born for greatness ?

1734
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,720
? A life so animated that nothing can contain it ?

1735
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,890
? Leveled up like we knew all the levels from the start ?

1736
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:12,640
? I hope you feeling like a star ?

1737
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:15,810
? We're gonna show the whole world who we are ?

1738
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:18,810
? All those days we were searching for ?

1739
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:21,780
? Something meaningful, something more ?

1740
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,530
? Like the good life, good life ?

1741
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:27,360
? We were longing for the good life ?

1742
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:29,490
? Good li-i-i-ife ?

1743
01:34:29,490 --> 01:34:34,500
? I knew we'd get here, never doubted, never doubted it ?

1744
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:37,670
? If we are in a dream, then I ain't coming out of it ?

1745
01:34:37,670 --> 01:34:39,000
? Speeding through the clouds ?

1746
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,790
? So you better hold on, grip tight ?

1747
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,590
? Ready for the spotlight, we heading for the good life ?

1748
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:46,550
? I feel lucky ?

1749
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,090
? And I feel blessed ?

1750
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:49,510
? The sun is shining ?

1751
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:52,310
? So take a breath of ?

1752
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:55,270
? The good life, good life ?

1753
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:56,850
? We heading for the good life ?

1754
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:58,690
? Good li-i-i-ife ?

1755
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:01,270
? The sun is out, so am I ?

1756
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:03,190
? Let's get our wings on to fly ?

1757
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:05,030
? I feel the magic around ?

1758
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:08,240
? Nobody stopping us now ?

1759
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:10,200
? With you here by my side ?

1760
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,830
? I can feel where we can glide ?

1761
01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:13,740
? So much higher than the sky ?

1762
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,370
? Oh, oh ?

1763
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:17,750
? We heading for ?

1764
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:20,130
? The good life, yeah ?

1765
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:21,500
? We heading for ?

1766
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:22,840
? The good life ?

1767
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,090
? Uh-uh ?

1768
01:35:24,090 --> 01:35:25,090
? We heading for ?

1769
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:26,720
? The good life ?

1770
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,880
? We heading for ?

1771
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,050
? The good life ?

1772
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:31,300
? Good life, good life ?

1773
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:33,720
? Get ready for the good life ?

1774
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,060
? Good life ?

1775
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:36,600
? We heading for the good life ?

1776
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,020
? Uh-uh, we heading for the good life ?

1777
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:42,060
? It's the good, it's the good ?

1778
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,820
? It's the good life ?

1779
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:45,980
? Good life, good life ?

1780
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,950
? Get ready for the good life, good life ?

1781
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:53,330
? We heading for the good life, good life ?

1782
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:54,910
? Get ready for the good life ?

1783
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:56,910
? Good li-i-i-ife ?

1784
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:58,410
? Good life ?

1785
01:35:58,410 --> 01:36:01,080
? Good life, good life... ?

1786
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:21,710
我就喜欢计划成功的感觉
I love it when a plan comes together.

1787
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:24,090
现在是时候回家了
And now time to go home.

1788
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:51,720
? You ain't courageous enough ?

1789
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,470
?Most of you probably fold ?  ?Yeah ?

1790
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:55,050
? You ain't willing to the face the challenge ?

1791
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:56,720
?Acquire the gold ?  ?Yeah ?

1792
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,430
? We only here to just retrieve what you probably stole ?

1793
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:01,100
? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ?

1794
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:02,640
? You see, steel sharpen steel ?

1795
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,190
?When it's time for the go ?  ?Yeah ?

1796
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:05,560
? We here to create such a ruckus ?

1797
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,150
?We all on a roll ?  ?Yeah ?

1798
01:37:07,150 --> 01:37:08,440
? Stare every challenge in the eye ?

1799
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,280
? We don't play with the soul ?

1828
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:14,970

01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:35,150
? And we hop out of every situation ?

1837
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:36,740
? Best believe that it's time to blow ?

1848
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:02,390
? You know we get a little crazy ?

1849
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:03,850

1854
01:39:10,730 --> 01:39:12,610
? To trap us, and they come from every corner ?

1855
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:14,610
? And they really try to catch us, we're completing ?

1856
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:16,490
? Every mission no matter how they attack us, and the fact ?

1857
